      <description>Welcome to my blog! My name is Jonathan. Since 2007, I’ve worked as a Biochemistry Officer in the Army. My graduate training was in cellular and molecular pathology, but I’ve conducted research in many areas to meet the Army mission. I mentored graduate medical education residents and fellows in basic and clinical research in the areas of trauma, maternal fetal medicine, reproductive biology, and general medicine. I’ve also served as a Program Director and a Deputy Commander at a military research lab.</description>
