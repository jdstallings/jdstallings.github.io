	N2 = {Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are unpleasant experiences. However, there is no drug that is completely effective in preventing PONV. Whereas cost effectiveness analyses rely on specific health outcomes (e.g., years of life saved), cost-benefit analyses assess the cost and benefit of medical therapy in terms of dollars. We hypothesized that patients were willing to pay for a hypothetical new drug that would eliminate PONV. Eighty elective day surgical patients using general anesthesia participated in the study. After their recovery in the postanesthetic care unit, they were asked to complete an interactive computer questionnaire on demographics, the value of avoiding PONV, and their willingness to pay for an antiemetic. Patients were willing to pay US{\$}56 (US{\$}26--US{\$}97; median, 25{\%}--75{\%}) for an antiemetic that would completely prevent PONV. Patients who developed nausea (n = 21; 26{\%}) and vomiting (n = 9; 11{\%}) were willing to pay US{\$}73 (US{\$}44--US{\$}110) and {\$}100 (US{\$}61--US{\$}200; median, 25{\%}--75{\%}), respectively (P < 0.05). Seventy-six percent of patients considered avoiding postoperative nausea and 78{\%} of patients considered avoiding vomiting as important (≥50 mm on a 0--100-mm visual analog scale). Nausea or vomiting in the postanesthetic care unit, greater patient income, previous history of PONV, more importance placed on avoiding nausea and vomiting, increasing age, and being married are independent covariates that increase the willingness to pay estimates. Patients associated a value with the avoidance of PONV and were willing to pay between US{\$}56 and US{\$}100 for a completely effective antiemetic. Implications: We have established a cost-benefit analysis for an antiemetic therapy. Patients highly value avoiding postoperative nausea and vomiting. The amount they are willing to pay for a totally effective antiemetic is US$61--$US113..},

@article{Apfel04,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Untreated, one third of patients who undergo surgery will have postoperative nausea and vomiting. Although many trials have been conducted, the relative benefits of prophylactic antiemetic interventions given alone or in combination remain unknown. METHODS: We enrolled 5199 patients at high risk for postoperative nausea and vomiting in a randomized, controlled trial of factorial design that was powered to evaluate interactions among as many as three antiemetic interventions. Of these patients, 4123 were randomly assigned to 1 of 64 possible combinations of six prophylactic interventions: 4 mg of ondansetron or no ondansetron; 4 mg of dexamethasone or no dexamethasone; 1.25 mg of droperidol or no droperidol; propofol or a volatile anesthetic; nitrogen or nitrous oxide; and remifentanil or fentanyl. The remaining patients were randomly assigned with respect to the first four interventions. The primary outcome was nausea and vomiting within 24 hours after surgery, which was evaluated blindly. RESULTS: Ondansetron, dexamethasone, and droperidol each reduced the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting by about 26 percent. Propofol reduced the risk by 19 percent, and nitrogen by 12 percent; the risk reduction with both of these agents (i.e., total intravenous anesthesia) was thus similar to that observed with each of the antiemetics. All the interventions acted independently of one another and independently of the patients' baseline risk. Consequently, the relative risks associated with the combined interventions could be estimated by multiplying the relative risks associated with each intervention. Absolute risk reduction, though, was a critical function of patients' baseline risk. CONCLUSIONS: Because antiemetic interventions are similarly effective and act independently, the safest or least expensive should be used first. Prophylaxis is rarely warranted in low-risk patients, moderate-risk patients may benefit from a single intervention, and multiple interventions should be reserved for high-risk patients.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: About one in four patients suffers from postoperative nausea and vomiting. Fortunately, risk scores have been developed to better manage this outcome in hospitalized patients, but there is currently no risk score for postdischarge nausea and vomiting (PDNV) in ambulatory surgical patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective multicenter study of 2,170 adults undergoing general anesthesia at ambulatory surgery centers in the United States from 2007 to 2008. PDNV was assessed from discharge until the end of the second postoperative day. Logistic regression analysis was applied to a development dataset and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated in a validation dataset. RESULTS: The overall incidence of PDNV was 37%. Logistic regression analysis of the development dataset (n=1,913) identified five independent predictors (odds ratio; 95% CI): female gender (1.54; 1.22 to 1.94), age less than 50 yr (2.17; 1.75 to 2.69), history of nausea and/or vomiting after previous anesthesia (1.50; 1.19 to 1.88), opioid administration in the postanesthesia care unit (1.93; 1.53 to 2.43), and nausea in the postanesthesia care unit (3.14; 2.44-4.04). In the validation dataset (n=257), zero, one, two, three, four, and five of these factors were associated with a PDNV incidence of 7%, 20%, 28%, 53%, 60%, and 89%, respectively, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.72 (0.69 to 0.73). CONCLUSIONS: PDNV affects a substantial number of patients after ambulatory surgery. We developed and validated a simplified risk score to identify patients who would benefit from long-acting prophylactic antiemetics at discharge from the ambulatory care center.},

Many record reviews and a written survey of nurses in the postanesthesia care unit and same day surgery center revealed that little or no risk assessment and no consistent prophylaxis or treatment were in use by nurses, physicians, or anesthesia care providers. After a review of the literature and discussions with anesthesia care providers, we developed and put into practice a risk assessment tool and perioperative care path. A formal evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the plan was performed one year after implementation. We found that the rates of PONV had decreased to 16%. AORN J 90 (September 2009) 391-413.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative nausea and vomiting is a common and unpleasant phenomenon and current therapies are not always effective for all patients. Aromatherapy has been suggested as a possible addition to the available treatment strategies. OBJECTIVES: This review sought to establish what effect the use of aromatherapy has on the severity and duration of established postoperative nausea and vomiting and whether aromatherapy can be used with safety and clinical effectiveness comparable to standard pharmacological treatments. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 3); MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; CAM on PubMed; Meditext; LILACS; and ISI Web of Science as well as grey literature sources and the reference lists of retrieved articles. We conducted database searches up to August 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) where aromatherapy was used to treat postoperative nausea and vomiting. Interventions were all types of aromatherapy. Aromatherapy was defined as the inhalation of the vapours of any substance for the purposes of a therapeutic benefit. Primary outcomes were the severity and duration of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Secondary outcomes were adverse reactions, use of rescue anti-emetics and patient satisfaction with treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors assessed risk of bias in the included studies and extracted data. As all outcomes analysed were dichotomous, we used a fixed-effect model and calculated relative risk (RR) with associated 95% confidence interval (95% CI). MAIN RESULTS: The nine included studies comprised six RCTs and three CCTs with a total of 402 participants. The mean age and range data for all participants were not reported for all studies. The method of randomization in four of the six included RCTs was explicitly stated and was adequate. Incomplete reporting of data affected the completeness of the analysis. Compared with placebo, isopropyl alcohol vapour inhalation was effective in reducing the proportion of participants requiring rescue anti-emetics (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.00, P = 0.05). However, compared with standard anti-emetic treatment, isopropyl alcohol was not effective in reducing the proportion of participants requiring rescue anti-emetics (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.13, P = 0.13) except when the data from a possibly confounded study were included (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.98, P = 0.04). Where studies reported data on patient satisfaction with aromatherapy, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.03, P = 0.71). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Isopropyl alcohol was more effective than saline placebo for reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting but less effective than standard anti-emetic drugs. There is currently no reliable evidence for the use of peppermint oil.},

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a major concern for patients having surgery under general anesthesia as it causes subjective distress along with increased complications and delays in discharge from the hospital. Aromatherapy represents a complementary and alternative therapy for the management of PONV. PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of aromatherapy (QueaseEase, Soothing Scents, Inc, Enterprise, AL) versus an unscented inhalant in relieving PONV. METHODS: One hundred twenty-one patients with postoperative nausea were randomized into a treatment group receiving an aromatic inhaler and a control group receiving a placebo inhaler to evaluate the effectiveness of aromatherapy. FINDINGS: Initial and follow-up nausea assessment scores in both treatment and placebo groups decreased significantly (P < .01), and there was a significant difference between the two groups (P = .03). Perceived effectiveness of aromatherapy was significantly higher in the treatment group (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Aromatherapy was favorably received by most patients and represents an effective treatment option for postoperative nausea.},

@article{Kolcaba02,
	Abstract = {The Theory of Comfort and its application to the specialty of perianesthesia nursing are presented in this article. Comfort Theory is relevant to this specialty because patient comfort is cited as a goal in its standards of care and is an established value for many nurses in their perianesthesia practice. The technical definition of comfort, developed from reviews of multidisciplinary literature on comfort and nursing literature on holism, is "the state of being strengthened by having needs for relief, ease, and transcendence met in 4 contexts of experience (physical, psychospiritual, sociocultural, and environmental)." (Kolcaba K. Adv Nurs Sci. 15:1-10, 1992). Because comfort has many interrelated aspects, interventions designed to enhance comfort in one aspect can have a larger effect on total comfort than expected. Particular emphasis is placed on interventions to treat anxiety, because this discomfort can be severe and can negatively affect physiologic function. Goals and comfort measures for each phase of perianesthesia care are presented, followed by application of Comfort Theory for research.},

@article{Kranke01,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: An increased Body Mass Index (BMI) is almost always mentioned as a fundamental risk factor for postoperative nausea (PN), vomiting (PV) or both (PONV). However, multivariate analyses were unable to detect any correlation. Therefore, we asked whether an increased BMI is really a risk factor for PONV. METHODS: For the systematic review, a search of electronic databases and a detailed manual search of reviews were carried out. For the analysis of the original data, 587 adult patients from a randomised controlled antiemetic trial (RCT) who underwent general anaesthesia were allocated to four weight groups: Underweight (BMI < 20), Normal Weight (BMI 20-25), Overweight (BMI 25-30) and Obesity (BMI > or = 30). RESULTS: Four publications with original data were found. Two described a positive relationship, although not clearly supported by the data. Despite this, most narrative reviews claimed a positive correlation between obesity and PONV by quoting again narrative reviews or misquoting originals. In the RCT, the calculated underlying risk profile for PONV was comparable between all groups. Incidences (95% confidence intervals) of PONV were 45.8% (34.0; 57.6), 41.7 (36.5; 46.9), 47.8 (38.4; 57.1) and 44.1 (31.0; 57.1), for the groups Underweight, Normal Weight, Overweight and Obesity, respectively (P=0.69). The incidences of PN and PV also did not differ with P=0.76 and P=0.36, respectively. CONCLUSION: Systematic search of the literature provides no evidence for a positive relationship. Furthermore, our data confirm that an increased BMI is not a risk factor for PONV. This negative finding is important as focussing on the relevant risk factors is needed to allow for an objective risk assessment of PONV.},

	Abstract = {This study identified predictive factors for post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in patients using patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and developed five predictive model pathways to calculate the probability of PONV using decision tree analysis. The sample consisted of 1181 patients using PCA. Data were collected using: a specifically designed check-off form to collect patient-, surgery-, anaesthesia- and post-operation-related data; the Beck Anxiety Inventory to measure pre-operative anxiety; and a visual analogue scale, to measure post-operative pain. The incidence of PONV was 27.7%. Nine factors were highly predictive of PONV in our five model pathways: gender, obesity, anxiety, history of previous PONV, history of motion sickness, inhalation of nitrous oxide during operation, use of inhalational agents, starting oral fluid/food intake after operation, and post-operative pain. With these five predictive model pathways, we can predict the probability of PONV in an individual patient according to their individual characteristics.},

@article{Obrink15,
	Abstract = {Postoperative nausea and vomiting "the little big problem" after surgery/anaesthesia is still a common side-effect compromising quality of care, delaying discharge and resumption of activities of daily living. A huge number of studies have been conducted in order to identify risk factors, preventive and therapeutic strategies. The Apfel risk score and a risk based multi-modal PONV prophylaxis is advocated by evidence based guidelines as standards of care but is not always followed. Tailored anaesthesia and pain management avoiding too liberal dosing of anaesthetics and opioid analgesics is also essential in order to reduce risk. Thus multi-modal opioid sparing analgesia and a risk based PONV prophylaxis should be provided in order to minimise the occurrence. There is however still no way to guarantee an individual patient that he or she should not experience any PONV. Further studies are needed trying to identify risk factors and ways to tailor the individual patient prevention/therapy are warranted. The present paper provides a review around prediction, factors influencing the occurrence and the management of PONV with a focus on the ambulatory surgical patient.},
