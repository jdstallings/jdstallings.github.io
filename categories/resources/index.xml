      <description>Here are the books I’ve acquired over the last two years. After dabbling from 2012 to 2013, I started buying books. Many of the ones toward the end of the list you may find hardly worth your time. The web design, Java, and other similar books were typically obtained because they were free or inexpensive and I needed some quick solutions. I plan to update this library, web content, and I’ll add key manuscripts as time goes by.</description>
