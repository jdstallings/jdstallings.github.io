      <description>We leverage Reproducible Research, which…
 ties specific instructions to data analysis and experimental data so that scholarship can be recreated, better understood and verified. Packages in R for this purpose can be split into groups for: literate programming, package reproducibility, code/data formatting tools, format convertors, and object caching. The primary way that R facilitates reproducible research is using a document that is a combination of content and data analysis code.</description>
